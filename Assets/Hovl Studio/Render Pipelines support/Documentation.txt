The editor replaces shaders in the materials to make effects work with different Rendering Pipelines.
Works only with Hovl Studio assets - https://assetstore.unity.com/publishers/28391

Before using the editor, unzip the desired .unitypackage for your Render Pipeline.
Render Pipeline names are written on Unity archives. Be very careful!
Files are placed in the .unitypackages because without a pre-loaded RP they can cause errors!

Using: 
Go to tab "Tools > Pipeline changer for Hovl Studio assets"
After opening the window, select the desired Render Pipeline.

If you imported the wrong asset - just delete: Hovl Studio > Render Pipelines support > shaders


IMPORTANT! All shaders are oriented to work with Linear color space.
For Gamma color space follow instruction in the screenshot and change HDRP_Blend_TwoSides or LWRP_Blend_TwoSides shader (depending on your render pipeline).

Don't forget to enable Depth texture, Opaque texture and HDR for URP(LWRP).
